## Overview

The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. This TypeScript SDK implements the full MCP specification, making it easy to:

* Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
* Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
* Use standard transports like stdio and Streamable HTTP
* Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events

## Installation

```
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

## Quick Start

Let's create a simple MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data:

```
import { McpServer, ResourceTemplate } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

// Create an MCP server
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Demo",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Add an addition tool
server.tool("add",
  { a: z.number(), b: z.number() },
  async ({ a, b }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: String(a + b) }]
  })
);

// Add a dynamic greeting resource
server.resource(
  "greeting",
  new ResourceTemplate("greeting://{name}", { list: undefined }),
  async (uri, { name }) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: `Hello, ${name}!`
    }]
  })
);

// Start receiving messages on stdin and sending messages on stdout
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

* Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
* Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
* Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
* And more!

## Core Concepts

### Server

The McpServer is your core interface to the MCP protocol. It handles connection management, protocol compliance, and message routing:

```
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "My App",
  version: "1.0.0"
});
```

### Resources

Resources are how you expose data to LLMs. They're similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects:

```
// Static resource
server.resource(
  "config",
  "config://app",
  async (uri) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: "App configuration here"
    }]
  })
);

// Dynamic resource with parameters
server.resource(
  "user-profile",
  new ResourceTemplate("users://{userId}/profile", { list: undefined }),
  async (uri, { userId }) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: `Profile data for user ${userId}`
    }]
  })
);
```

### Tools

Tools let LLMs take actions through your server. Unlike resources, tools are expected to perform computation and have side effects:

```
// Simple tool with parameters
server.tool(
  "calculate-bmi",
  {
    weightKg: z.number(),
    heightM: z.number()
  },
  async ({ weightKg, heightM }) => ({
    content: [{
      type: "text",
      text: String(weightKg / (heightM * heightM))
    }]
  })
);

// Async tool with external API call
server.tool(
  "fetch-weather",
  { city: z.string() },
  async ({ city }) => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.weather.com/${city}`);
    const data = await response.text();
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: data }]
    };
  }
);
```

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates that help LLMs interact with your server effectively:

```
server.prompt(
  "review-code",
  { code: z.string() },
  ({ code }) => ({
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: `Please review this code:\n\n${code}`
      }
    }]
  })
);
```

## Running Your Server

MCP servers in TypeScript need to be connected to a transport to communicate with clients. How you start the server depends on the choice of transport:

### stdio

For command-line tools and direct integrations:

```
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// ... set up server resources, tools, and prompts ...

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Streamable HTTP

For remote servers, set up a Streamable HTTP transport that handles both client requests and server-to-client notifications.

#### With Session Management

In some cases, servers need to be stateful. This is achieved by [session management](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#session-management).

```
import express from "express";
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import { isInitializeRequest } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js"



const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Map to store transports by session ID
const transports: { [sessionId: string]: StreamableHTTPServerTransport } = {};

// Handle POST requests for client-to-server communication
app.post('/mcp', async (req, res) => {
  // Check for existing session ID
  const sessionId = req.headers['mcp-session-id'] as string | undefined;
  let transport: StreamableHTTPServerTransport;

  if (sessionId && transports[sessionId]) {
    // Reuse existing transport
    transport = transports[sessionId];
  } else if (!sessionId && isInitializeRequest(req.body)) {
    // New initialization request
    transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
      sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID(),
      onsessioninitialized: (sessionId) => {
        // Store the transport by session ID
        transports[sessionId] = transport;
      }
    });

    // Clean up transport when closed
    transport.onclose = () => {
      if (transport.sessionId) {
        delete transports[transport.sessionId];
      }
    };
    const server = new McpServer({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    });

    // ... set up server resources, tools, and prompts ...

    // Connect to the MCP server
    await server.connect(transport);
  } else {
    // Invalid request
    res.status(400).json({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      error: {
        code: -32000,
        message: 'Bad Request: No valid session ID provided',
      },
      id: null,
    });
    return;
  }

  // Handle the request
  await transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
});

// Reusable handler for GET and DELETE requests
const handleSessionRequest = async (req: express.Request, res: express.Response) => {
  const sessionId = req.headers['mcp-session-id'] as string | undefined;
  if (!sessionId || !transports[sessionId]) {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid or missing session ID');
    return;
  }
  
  const transport = transports[sessionId];
  await transport.handleRequest(req, res);
};

// Handle GET requests for server-to-client notifications via SSE
app.get('/mcp', handleSessionRequest);

// Handle DELETE requests for session termination
app.delete('/mcp', handleSessionRequest);

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Without Session Management (Stateless)

For simpler use cases where session management isn't needed:

```
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/mcp', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // In stateless mode, create a new instance of transport and server for each request
  // to ensure complete isolation. A single instance would cause request ID collisions
  // when multiple clients connect concurrently.
  
  try {
    const server = getServer(); 
    const transport: StreamableHTTPServerTransport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
      sessionIdGenerator: undefined,
    });
    res.on('close', () => {
      console.log('Request closed');
      transport.close();
      server.close();
    });
    await server.connect(transport);
    await transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error handling MCP request:', error);
    if (!res.headersSent) {
      res.status(500).json({
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        error: {
          code: -32603,
          message: 'Internal server error',
        },
        id: null,
      });
    }
  }
});

app.get('/mcp', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log('Received GET MCP request');
  res.writeHead(405).end(JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    error: {
      code: -32000,
      message: "Method not allowed."
    },
    id: null
  }));
});

app.delete('/mcp', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log('Received DELETE MCP request');
  res.writeHead(405).end(JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    error: {
      code: -32000,
      message: "Method not allowed."
    },
    id: null
  }));
});


// Start the server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`MCP Stateless Streamable HTTP Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

This stateless approach is useful for:

* Simple API wrappers
* RESTful scenarios where each request is independent
* Horizontally scaled deployments without shared session state

### Testing and Debugging

To test your server, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector). See its README for more information.

## Examples

### Echo Server

A simple server demonstrating resources, tools, and prompts:

```
import { McpServer, ResourceTemplate } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Echo",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

server.resource(
  "echo",
  new ResourceTemplate("echo://{message}", { list: undefined }),
  async (uri, { message }) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: `Resource echo: ${message}`
    }]
  })
);

server.tool(
  "echo",
  { message: z.string() },
  async ({ message }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: `Tool echo: ${message}` }]
  })
);

server.prompt(
  "echo",
  { message: z.string() },
  ({ message }) => ({
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: `Please process this message: ${message}`
      }
    }]
  })
);
```

### SQLite Explorer

A more complex example showing database integration:

```
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import sqlite3 from "sqlite3";
import { promisify } from "util";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "SQLite Explorer",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Helper to create DB connection
const getDb = () => {
  const db = new sqlite3.Database("database.db");
  return {
    all: promisify<string, any[]>(db.all.bind(db)),
    close: promisify(db.close.bind(db))
  };
};

server.resource(
  "schema",
  "schema://main",
  async (uri) => {
    const db = getDb();
    try {
      const tables = await db.all(
        "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"
      );
      return {
        contents: [{
          uri: uri.href,
          text: tables.map((t: {sql: string}) => t.sql).join("\n")
        }]
      };
    } finally {
      await db.close();
    }
  }
);

server.tool(
  "query",
  { sql: z.string() },
  async ({ sql }) => {
    const db = getDb();
    try {
      const results = await db.all(sql);
      return {
        content: [{
          type: "text",
          text: JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)
        }]
      };
    } catch (err: unknown) {
      const error = err as Error;
      return {
        content: [{
          type: "text",
          text: `Error: ${error.message}`
        }],
        isError: true
      };
    } finally {
      await db.close();
    }
  }
);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Dynamic Servers

If you want to offer an initial set of tools/prompts/resources, but later add additional ones based on user action or external state change, you can add/update/remove them *after* the Server is connected. This will automatically emit the corresponding `listChanged` notifications:

```
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Dynamic Example",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

const listMessageTool = server.tool(
  "listMessages",
  { channel: z.string() },
  async ({ channel }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: await listMessages(channel) }]
  })
);

const putMessageTool = server.tool(
  "putMessage",
  { channel: z.string(), message: z.string() },
  async ({ channel, message }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: await putMessage(channel, string) }]
  })
);
// Until we upgrade auth, `putMessage` is disabled (won't show up in listTools)
putMessageTool.disable()

const upgradeAuthTool = server.tool(
  "upgradeAuth",
  { permission: z.enum(["write', admin"])},
  // Any mutations here will automatically emit `listChanged` notifications
  async ({ permission }) => {
    const { ok, err, previous } = await upgradeAuthAndStoreToken(permission)
    if (!ok) return {content: [{ type: "text", text: `Error: ${err}` }]}

    // If we previously had read-only access, 'putMessage' is now available
    if (previous === "read") {
      putMessageTool.enable()
    }

    if (permission === 'write') {
      // If we've just upgraded to 'write' permissions, we can still call 'upgradeAuth' 
      // but can only upgrade to 'admin'. 
      upgradeAuthTool.update({
        paramSchema: { permission: z.enum(["admin"]) }, // change validation rules
      })
    } else {
      // If we're now an admin, we no longer have anywhere to upgrade to, so fully remove that tool
      upgradeAuthTool.remove()
    }
  }
)

// Connect as normal
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Low-Level Server

For more control, you can use the low-level Server class directly:

```
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import {
  ListPromptsRequestSchema,
  GetPromptRequestSchema
} from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js";

const server = new Server(
  {
    name: "example-server",
    version: "1.0.0"
  },
  {
    capabilities: {
      prompts: {}
    }
  }
);

server.setRequestHandler(ListPromptsRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    prompts: [{
      name: "example-prompt",
      description: "An example prompt template",
      arguments: [{
        name: "arg1",
        description: "Example argument",
        required: true
      }]
    }]
  };
});

server.setRequestHandler(GetPromptRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  if (request.params.name !== "example-prompt") {
    throw new Error("Unknown prompt");
  }
  return {
    description: "Example prompt",
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: "Example prompt text"
      }
    }]
  };
});

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Writing MCP Clients

The SDK provides a high-level client interface:

```
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";

const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: "node",
  args: ["server.js"]
});

const client = new Client(
  {
    name: "example-client",
    version: "1.0.0"
  }
);

await client.connect(transport);

// List prompts
const prompts = await client.listPrompts();

// Get a prompt
const prompt = await client.getPrompt({
  name: "example-prompt",
  arguments: {
    arg1: "value"
  }
});

// List resources
const resources = await client.listResources();

// Read a resource
const resource = await client.readResource({
  uri: "file:///example.txt"
});

// Call a tool
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "example-tool",
  arguments: {
    arg1: "value"
  }
});
```

### Proxy Authorization Requests Upstream

You can proxy OAuth requests to an external authorization provider:

```
import express from 'express';
import { ProxyOAuthServerProvider } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/auth/providers/proxyProvider.js';
import { mcpAuthRouter } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/auth/router.js';

const app = express();

const proxyProvider = new ProxyOAuthServerProvider({
    endpoints: {
        authorizationUrl: "https://auth.external.com/oauth2/v1/authorize",
        tokenUrl: "https://auth.external.com/oauth2/v1/token",
        revocationUrl: "https://auth.external.com/oauth2/v1/revoke",
    },
    verifyAccessToken: async (token) => {
        return {
            token,
            clientId: "123",
            scopes: ["openid", "email", "profile"],
        }
    },
    getClient: async (client_id) => {
        return {
            client_id,
            redirect_uris: ["http://localhost:3000/callback"],
        }
    }
})

app.use(mcpAuthRouter({
    provider: proxyProvider,
    issuerUrl: new URL("http://auth.external.com"),
    baseUrl: new URL("http://mcp.example.com"),
    serviceDocumentationUrl: new URL("https://docs.example.com/"),
}))
```

This setup allows you to:

* Forward OAuth requests to an external provider
* Add custom token validation logic
* Manage client registrations
* Provide custom documentation URLs
* Maintain control over the OAuth flow while delegating to an external provider

### Backwards Compatibility

Clients and servers with StreamableHttp tranport can maintain [backwards compatibility](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#backwards-compatibility) with the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport (from protocol version 2024-11-05) as follows

#### Client-Side Compatibility

For clients that need to work with both Streamable HTTP and older SSE servers:

```
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";
import { SSEClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/sse.js";
let client: Client|undefined = undefined
const baseUrl = new URL(url);
try {
  client = new Client({
    name: 'streamable-http-client',
    version: '1.0.0'
  });
  const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(
    new URL(baseUrl)
  );
  await client.connect(transport);
  console.log("Connected using Streamable HTTP transport");
} catch (error) {
  // If that fails with a 4xx error, try the older SSE transport
  console.log("Streamable HTTP connection failed, falling back to SSE transport");
  client = new Client({
    name: 'sse-client',
    version: '1.0.0'
  });
  const sseTransport = new SSEClientTransport(baseUrl);
  await client.connect(sseTransport);
  console.log("Connected using SSE transport");
}
```

#### Server-Side Compatibility

For servers that need to support both Streamable HTTP and older clients:

```
import express from "express";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "backwards-compatible-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// ... set up server resources, tools, and prompts ...

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Store transports for each session type
const transports = {
  streamable: {} as Record<string, StreamableHTTPServerTransport>,
  sse: {} as Record<string, SSEServerTransport>
};

// Modern Streamable HTTP endpoint
app.all('/mcp', async (req, res) => {
  // Handle Streamable HTTP transport for modern clients
  // Implementation as shown in the "With Session Management" example
  // ...
});

// Legacy SSE endpoint for older clients
app.get('/sse', async (req, res) => {
  // Create SSE transport for legacy clients
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  transports.sse[transport.sessionId] = transport;
  
  res.on("close", () => {
    delete transports.sse[transport.sessionId];
  });
  
  await server.connect(transport);
});

// Legacy message endpoint for older clients
app.post('/messages', async (req, res) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
  const transport = transports.sse[sessionId];
  if (transport) {
    await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res, req.body);
  } else {
    res.status(400).send('No transport found for sessionId');
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Note**: The SSE transport is now deprecated in favor of Streamable HTTP. New implementations should use Streamable HTTP, and existing SSE implementations should plan to migrate.

## Pick the right model, fast

Run side-by-side evaluations to compare outputs from industry-leading models in real time. No guesswork, just better results.

## Manage prompts like code

Version, share, and reuse your prompts across projects. Treat AI inputs as first-class development assets, just like your source code.

## Secure by design

Control which models your team can use, keep data and prompts private, and ensure everything runs within GitHub and Azure infrastructure.

## Building with AI, made easy

### Frequently asked questions

#### What is GitHub Models?

GitHub Models brings AI directly into the developer workflow by providing access to multiple leading models through a single API key. It allows teams to manage prompts as code, run side-by-side model evaluations, and move from testing to production within the same environment they already use.

#### Is GitHub Models different from GitHub Copilot?

Yes, GitHub Models is a separate product, outside of GitHub Copilot. GitHub Models is free for everyone to get started building AI with and can be leveraged directly within GitHub.

#### What is the Models playground?

GitHub Models includes a playground where you can explore a curated selection of AI models from providers like OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft. There you can experiment with prompts, tweak parameters (such as temperature or max tokens), and see how different models respond, all in real time.

## Become a risk reduction warrior

Stay ahead of threats with built-in security, secret protection, and dependency monitoring.

The GitHub Copilot Autofix feature is generating a fix suggestion.](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/bento-1-578d8af7abcd.webp)

### Strengthen your development with AI

Write secure code at scale with AI-driven insights and automated fixes from GitHub Copilot Autofix.

![Screenshot displaying a code snippet with a highlighted Copilot Autofix suggestion. The original code sends a response with user-provided query name directly, and the suggested fix escapes the user-provided query name to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerability.](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/bento-2-b0f420f92f3e.webp)

### Empower your team with native AppSec

Find and fix vulnerabilities in real time by integrating application security right into GitHub.

### Frequently asked questions

#### What is GitHub Advanced Security?

GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) encompasses GitHub’s application security products comprising GitHub Secret Protection and GitHub Code Security. GHAS adds cutting-edge tools for static analysis, software composition analysis, and secret scanning to the GitHub platform that developers already know and love. Unlike traditional application security packages that burden the software development toolchain with complex workflows that inhibit adoption, GHAS makes it easy for developers to find and fix vulnerabilities earlier in the software development life cycle.

#### Why choose GitHub Advanced Security instead of a third-party AppSec product?

Unlike third-party security add-ons, GitHub Advanced Security operates entirely in the native GitHub workflows that developers already know and love. By making it easier for developers to remediate vulnerabilities as they go, GitHub Advanced Security frees time for security teams to focus on critical strategies that protect businesses, customers, and communities from application-based vulnerabilities.

#### What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps refers to a combination of the development, security, and operations tools necessary to develop software applications.

#### What is AppSec?

Application security (AppSec) is the process of finding, fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities in applications. GitHub Advanced Security provides AppSec tools for static application security testing (SAST), which identifies vulnerabilities in the code itself.

#### Can I use GitHub Advanced Security with Microsoft Azure DevOps?

Yes. GitHub Advanced Security is available as an [add-on](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/github-advanced-security) for Azure DevOps.

#### Where can I find case studies and reference customers?

Read our [customer stories](https://github.com/customer-stories) to learn how customers like [Telus](https://github.com/customer-stories/telus), [Mercado Libre](https://github.com/customer-stories/mercado-libre), and [KPMG](https://github.com/customer-stories/kpmg) use GitHub Advanced Security to secure applications and accelerate the software development lifecycle.

#### Can I review documentation before purchase?

Yes. As with all GitHub products, [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) for GitHub Advanced Security is publicly available.

#### Does GitHub offer consulting, training, and other deployment services?

Yes! Please visit [Expert Services](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/about-autofix-for-codeql-code-scanning) to learn more.

A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, GitHub Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With GitHub Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use GitHub Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, GitHub Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, student, faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create GitHub Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the GitHub Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the GitHub Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, GitHub Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to [copilot-safety@github.com](mailto:copilot-safety@github.com) so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

That information is sent to GitHub Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with GitHub Copilot throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to [copilot-safety@github.com](mailto:copilot-safety@github.com) so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

GitHub Actions

# Automate your workflow from idea to production

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

[Get started with actions](https://docs.github.com/actions)[Contact sales](/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+Sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Factions&scid=&utm_campaign=Actions_feature_page_contact_sales_cta_utmroutercampaign&utm_content=Actions&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)

![Screenshot of a GitHub Actions workflow titled 'matrix-build-deploy.yml' displaying a pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Publish. The Build stage has completed successfully in 1 minute and 42 seconds. The Test stage includes builds for Linux, macOS, and Windows, all of which have also completed successfully with their respective durations. The final stage, Publish, shows that the publishing steps for Linux, macOS, and Windows are pending and waiting for approval. The background features a gradient transitioning from green to blue to turquoise.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/KiQBgcnMQg6dALaS6erGk/f8d49c0cc5a461b903e52d08c3c3b8f6/actions-hero.webp?fm=webp)

## Kick off workflows on any GitHub event to automate tasks

### Hosted runners

Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM, GPU, and containers make it easy to build and test all your projects. Run directly on a VM or inside a container. Use your own VMs, in the cloud or on-prem, with self-hosted runners.

### Matrix builds

Save time with matrix workflows that simultaneously test across multiple operating systems and versions of your runtime.

### Any language

GitHub Actions supports Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, .NET, and more. Build, test, and deploy applications in your language of choice.

### Live logs

See your workflow run in realtime with color and emoji. It’s one click to copy a link that highlights a specific line number to share a CI/CD failure.

### Built in secret store

Automate your software development practices with workflow files embracing the Git flow by codifying it in your repository.

### Multi-container testing

Test your web service and its DB in your workflow by simply adding some docker-compose to your workflow file.

### Run a workflow  on any event

Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate welcoming new users to your open source projects—there's an action for that. Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency resolution, using your existing GITHUB\_TOKEN.

![Screenshot showing the results of a successful GitHub Actions workflow. The header indicates that 'All checks have passed,' with three successful checks listed below. The checks include 'Build,' which completed successfully in 42 seconds, 'Test,' which completed in 5 minutes, and 'Code scanning / CodeQL,' which completed in 30 seconds. Each check has a corresponding 'Details' link. At the bottom, there is a green 'Merge pull request' button, indicating that the pull request is ready to be merged. The background features a gradient from green to teal.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/1e4I96ILCuSCaiFUQMeLLW/a78a371df7b10914a8f2099a0c95ab0b/features-action-river-event.webp)

### Actions marketplace

![Screenshot of a GitHub Actions workflow file being edited. The cursor is in the 'on' section of the YAML file, with a dropdown menu showing various triggers such as push, issue_creation, new_release, workflow_dispatch, and others. The code includes steps to set up a Node.js environment and run tests. On the right side of the screen, there is a 'Marketplace' panel displaying featured actions like 'Setup Node.js environment,' 'Setup Java JDK,' 'Setup .NET Core SDK,' and 'Download a Build Artifact.' The background features a gradient from green to teal.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5kVxaacutdvGyusbgk64iw/23fa8c76260945d6a8f28327e9910397/actions-river-breakout.webp)

*GitHub Actions connects all of your tools* to automate every step of your development workflow.

[Explore the actions marketplace](/marketplace?type=actions)

* Easily deploy to any cloud, create tickets in Jira, or publish a package to npm.
* *Want to venture off the beaten path?* Use the millions of open source libraries available on GitHub to create your own actions. Write them in JavaScript or create a container action—both can interact with the full GitHub API and any other public API.

### Secure package registry for code and workflows

Securely store and manage your code and packages with GitHub credentials, integrated into your workflows via APIs and webhooks. Enjoy fast, reliable downloads through a global CDN for optimized performance.

[Read the docs](https://docs.github.com/packages)

![Screenshot of a terminal window showing Docker commands to log in to GitHub's container registry (ghcr.io), tag an application image, and push the image version (1.0.0) to the repository, with a successful login and digest confirmation.

> *Actions is an exciting development and unlocks so much potential beyond CI/CD.* It promises to streamline our workflows for a variety of tasks, from deploying our websites to querying the GitHub API for custom status reports to standard CI builds.

![The image shows a code editor with an HTML file on the left and a webpage preview on the right. The preview features "Mona Sans. A Variable Font" as the main heading, followed by a description: "Mona Sans is a strong and versatile typeface. Designed with Degasrim and inspired by industrial-era grotesques." Below this text, there is an illustration of a character resembling an octopus holding various tools. The image demonstrates real-time editing and previewing of web content, useful for developers working on web design or front-end development projects.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/301u29BCKZVbXYLhQR1hu3/16eb65f687a079d79a0255d3ebabfdbb/features-codespaces-hero.webp?fm=webp)

## Secure by design

Created with security in mind, Codespaces provides a secure development environment through its built-in capabilities and native integration with GitHub.

![The image features a gradient background transitioning from green at the top to blue at the bottom. There are three black rectangular boxes with rounded corners, each containing a green checkmark icon on the left and white text. The first box reads "Isolated Environments," the second box reads "Access Control," and the third box reads "Cost Control." This image appears to be highlighting key features or benefits, possibly related to a software or service that emphasizes isolation, access management, and cost efficiency.

## Collaborate  where you code

Codespaces provides a shared development environment and removes the need for complex, time consuming setups.

![The image displays a JSON configuration file for setting up a development environment. It includes settings for forwarding ports (80, 2222, 3003, 3033, 3040, 28081), installing dependencies with the command "npm install," and enabling Visual Studio Code extensions. The terminal setting is configured to use "/bin/bash".

At the top right, there are options for different core configurations.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5kQRGLt3dEgZqraqssC3kL/368efb01e151493475985a0e194abfff/codespaces-river-breakout.webp)

*Your space, your way.* Codespaces is a home away from home for your code that feels just like your usual machine.

* *Start coding instantly from anywhere in the world.* Switching projects? Grab a new machine from the cloud that’s preconfigured for that project. Your settings travel with you.
* *Tabs or spaces? Monokai or Solarized? Prettier or Beautify? It’s up to you.* Control every nerdy detail only you care about with your own dotfiles repository.

## Browser preview and port forwarding

Preview your changes and get feedback from teammates by sharing ports within the scope allowed by policy.

![The image shows a computer screen with three overlapping windows. The main window displays a web browser with the URL "mono-github-g95jq2w5wf7.github.dev" on the Inbox page with the text "Howdy Mona" in the body of the page. There is text below "Howdy Mona" that says "You have 6 tasks and 3 messages" Two smaller windows are overlaid on top of this main window. One is a context menu with options such as "Open in Browser," "Set Port Label," "Set label and update devcontainer.json", "Copy local address", "Make Public", "Change Port Protocol", "Stop Forwarding Port", and "Forward a port" with "Make Public" being hovered. The other is a ports panel listing four ports: web (3000), hmr (55306), mysql (3306), and api (3001).](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/aGwuMiJ99BFm0IZOx7aBc/9d524ffddfa0091447b6f00d6d5d6473/features-codespaces-port-forwarding.webp)

## Onboard faster

Quickly spin up a codespace with only an IDE or browser and a GitHub account. With a few configuration files, you can give your developers an instant, fully configured, and secure development environment so they can start coding immediately.

![The image displays a user interface with three project cards, each showcasing the project's name, branch, and status. The first card is titled "mn-webgl-sandbox" with the branch "webgl-changes" and has 6 downvotes and 6 upvotes. It is marked as "Active" with a green dot indicator. The second card is titled "ui refactoring" with the branch "layout-refactor" and has 2 downvotes and 4 upvotes. It is also marked as "Active" with a green dot indicator. The third card is titled "psychic space doodle" with the branch "node-extensions" and has 5 downvotes and 1 upvote. This card too is marked as "Active" with a green dot indicator.

### Frequently asked questions

#### How does Codespaces work?

A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. Customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by [configuring dev container files](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project) to your repository (often known as configuration-as-code), which creates a repeatable codespace configuration for all users of your project.

GitHub Codespaces run on a various VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub.com, which you can configure from 2 core machines up to 32 core machines. Connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.

#### How do I use Codespaces?

There are a number of entry points to spin up a Codespaces environment, including:

* A [template](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).
* [Your repository](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace) for new feature work
* An [open pull request](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-for-pull-requests#opening-a-pull-request-in-codespaces) to explore work-in-progress
* A commit in the repository's history to investigate a bug at a specific point in time
* [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code#creating-a-codespace-in-vs-code)
* In beta, can you also use your [JetBrains IDE](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-your-jetbrains-ide) or [JupyterLab](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/getting-started-with-github-codespaces-for-machine-learning)

Learn more about how to use Codespaces in our [documentation](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/overview).

#### Is Codespaces available for individual developers?

Codespaces is available for developers in every organization, and under the control of the organization who pays for the user's codespace. All personal (individual) GitHub.com accounts include a quota of free usage each month, which organizations can enable (see the next question) for their private and internal repositories. GitHub will provide users in the free plan 120 core hours or 60 hours of run time on a 2 core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month. See how it's balanced on the [billing page](https://github.com/settings/billing).

#### Is Codespaces available for teams and companies?

Codespaces is available for teams and companies, but needs to be enabled first in an organization’s settings. Teams and companies can select which repositories and users have access to Codespaces for added security and permissioning control. Learn how to [enable Codespaces in an organization in our docs](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-github-codespaces-for-your-organization).

#### How much does Codespaces cost?

Codespaces is free for individual use up to 60 hours a month and comes with simple, pay-as-you-go pricing after that. It’s also available for organizations with pay-as-you-go pricing and has pricing controls so any company or team can determine how much they want to spend a month. Learn more about Codespaces pricing for organizations [here](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).

#### Can I self-host Codespaces?

Codespaces cannot be self-hosted.

#### How do I access Codespaces with LinkedIn Learning?

You can use Codespaces directly through LinkedIn Learning. LinkedIn Learning offers 50+ courses across six of the most popular coding languages, as well as data science and machine learning. These courses are integrated with Codespaces, so you can get hands-on practice anytime, from any machine via LinkedIn. These courses will be unlocked on LinkedIn Learning for free through Feb. 2023. Learn more about LinkedIn Learning and GitHub Codespaces [here](https://learning.linkedin.com/product/hands-on-practice).

#### How do I enable Codespaces on GitHub?

Codespaces is on by default for developers with a GitHub free account. If you belong to an organization, there may be a policy that prevents cloning—but if you can clone a repository, you will be able to start using Codespaces. Organizations will also need to pay for, enable, and manage their Codespaces instances.

#### Is Codespaces available for students?

Codespaces is available for free to students as part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Learn more about how to sign up and start using Codespaces and other GitHub products [here](https://education.github.com/pack).

#### Is Codespaces available for open source maintainers?

Codespaces provides both maintainers and contributors with [generous free monthly usage](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

# Project planning for developers

Create issues, break them into sub-issues, track progress, add custom fields, and have conversations. Visualize large projects as tables, boards, or roadmaps, and automate everything with code.

[Start using projects](https://docs.github.com/issues)[Contact sales](/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fissues&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)

![The image shows a project management dashboard for "OctoArcade Invaders." It is divided into three sections: "Prototype," "Beta," and "Launch." Each section lists tasks with their status, assignees, and progress. Tasks are labeled as "Complete," "In Progress," or "Not Started," with corresponding icons and progress bars indicating completion percentages.

## Features

![The image shows a project management interface with a dark theme, likely from a software development tool. The interface is divided into several sections. On the left side, there are squads listed "Squad 1" with 12 items, "Squad 2" with 3 items, and "Squad 3" with 16 items. Squad 1 has a list of tasks that are "Acquire domain for launch", "Hero site - development", "Integrate with backend", "Final creative shots from game", "Enable for teams", "Add leaderboard for Europe", "Marketing plan", "Email blast", and "Feedback intake". Squad 3 has a task labeled "Konami code easter egg". The main section displays a timeline showing when tasks will be completed.

*Bored of boards?* Switch to tables and roadmaps. Create views for how you work.

* *Save views for sprints, backlogs, teams, or releases.* Rank, group, sort, slice and filter to suit the occasion. Create swimlanes, share templates and set work in progress limits.
* *No mouse? No problem.* Every action you can take with the mouse has a keyboard shortcut or command. Filter, sort, group, and assign issues. Your hands never leave the keyboard.

### Custom fields

Track metadata like iterations, priority, story points, dates, notes, and links. Add custom fields to projects and edit from the issue sidebar.

![The image shows a task management board with a dark theme. It is divided into columns for Assignees, Labels, and Cycles. Each row lists an assignee's name, the label associated with their task (such as "Bug," "Need help," "Design," or "Back-end"). There is dropdown menu expanded under the "cycle" column that shows different data types. The data types are "Text", "Number", "Date", "Single select", and iteration. "Text" is currently selected. The board is used to track tasks assigned to different individuals and their current status.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/665ARAkl6YH4tPr0aWKDlL/d034ac805e10521fbff15a436be6f429/features-issues-river-3.webp)

### Track progress with project insights

Track the health of your current iteration cycle, milestone, or any other custom field you create with new project insights. Identify bottlenecks and issues blocking the team from making progress with the new burn up chart.

![The image shows a line graph with data from July 1 to July 13. The x-axis represents dates, and the y-axis represents numerical values from 0 to 175. Three lines are shown: purple for "Done", green for "In progress", blue for "To do", and pink for "No status". A tooltip on July 5 shows "Done: 74", "In progress: 55", "To do: 48", and "No status: 23".

### Share best practices with project templates

Create templates to share and reuse when getting started with a new project. Share inspiration across teams and get started with a single click.

![The image shows a project management dashboard titled "Team Planning" with tabs for Planning, Standup, and Iterations. The Planning tab is active, displaying six tasks under the "Kickoff" section. Tasks include confirming roles, verifying attendees, reviewing plans, creating release issues, writing a blog post, and setting up a daily triage loop. All tasks are marked as "Todo" with the milestone labeled "Kickoff".](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/510KpLxZ9zibGr4CstSNOA/47db94f0c15309cbf13a8e46a22bfc10/features-issues-river-5.webp)

## Manage work automatically

## What developers are saying

“

> The new planning and tracking functionality keeps my project management close to my code. I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.

## Flexible project planning for developers

### Frequently asked questions

#### What is GitHub Issues?

We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.

With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.

We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.

#### What are Projects?

As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.

The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.

#### What plans have access to Projects?

All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing).

#### Will the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?

Yes! GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) support follows our regular cadence of one to two quarters before enabling the on-premises functionality.

Code Review

# Write better code

On GitHub, lightweight code review tools are built into every pull request. Your team can create review processes that improve the quality of your code and fit neatly into your workflow.

[Get started](/pricing)[Contact sales](/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fcode-review&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)

## Every change starts with a pull request.

![The image shows a GitHub interface for opening a pull request. It features dropdown menus for selecting base and compare branches, a green checkmark indicating automatic merge capability, a text box for comments, and formatting options.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/4Yix4uMLoiBvceROXWNmKR/f431df88645e52013f22009ff36287ab/code-review-hero.webp)

Every change starts with a pull request.

[Learn pull request fundamentals](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

* *Start a new feature or propose a change to existing code with a pull request*—a base for your team to coordinate details and refine your changes.
* *Pull requests are fundamental to how teams review and improve code on GitHub.* Evolve projects, propose new features, and discuss implementation details before changing your source code.

## See every update and act on it, in-situ

## Discuss code within your code

### Comments

On GitHub, conversations happen alongside your code. Leave detailed comments on code syntax and ask questions about structure inline.

![The image shows a section of a user interface. At the top, there is a list with three items: "Line 10: Layouts" with a minus sign in red, "Line 11: Grid system" with a plus sign in green, and "Line 12: Layout are built on a 12 column grids." Below this list, there is a comment from the user "rajqflow" made 1 day ago that says, "Good cal, this is more specific!" The comment has received 5 thumbs-up likes and 2 heart reactions.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5gnwahjQ9gKBypJnMcLydF/0974d401891ea65109401c2678a71be7/features-code-review-river-1.webp)

### Review requests

If you’re on the other side of the code, requesting peer reviews is easy. Add users to your pull request, and they’ll receive a notification letting them know you need their feedback.

![The image shows a user interface for requesting a review. At the top, there is a text box with the placeholder "Request a review" and an input field below it containing the letter "o". Underneath the input field, there are two user suggestions: "kharyrizen Raymonda Khouri" with an avatar of a person, and "hankzolo Hank Zoeng" with an avatar of another person. ](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/67J4cJ8c4yrByoJ2R6arIy/d0520dc3a7c6596a94555ee32949a112/features-code-review-river-2.webp)

### Reviews

Save your teammates a few notifications. Bundle your comments into one cohesive review, then specify whether comments are required changes or just suggestions.

![The image displays a notification message. The notification features a red circle with a white 'X' icon and the title "Review required." Below the title, it states, "At least one approve review is required by reviewers to write access. Learn more." Additionally, there is an avatar of a person with the username "khayrizen" and text indicating that this user was requested for review.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/1g98EDjmSXX2a2bgJTJHSJ/66ba98c7358a1033981f9d8a166304dd/features-code-review-river-3.webp)

![Alert indicating a branch conflict with files that need to be resolved before merging.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/5B2ZvruiH8cWlanicpceng/0e1a12279aacf31d72a88034234cdf25/features-code-review-bento.webp)

## Merge the highest quality code

Reviews can improve your code, but mistakes happen. Limit human error and ensure only high quality code gets merged with detailed permissions and status checks.

### [Fast, relevant results](/pricing)

Give collaborators as much access as they need through your repository settings. You can extend access to a few teams and select which ones can read or write to your files. The options you have for permissions depend on your plan.

See plan options

### [Protected branches](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)

Protected Branches help you maintain the integrity of your code. Limit who can push to a branch, and disable force pushes to specific branches. Then scale your policies with the Protected Branches API.

Learn more

### [Required status checks](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses)

Create required status checks to add an extra layer of error prevention on branches. Use the Status API to enforce checks and disable the merge button until they pass. To err is human; to automate, divine!

![Screenshot of a GitHub Discussions page for the ’octoinvaders’ project, showing categorized discussion threads with tags like ’answered’ and ’Long term.’ The interface features playful elements like a mona emjoi and a rocket icon, highlighting community interaction.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/8ancmxwVvvSBuGiVfZCQ0/0e08bafd454ff1c993977c892581065d/discussions-hero.webp?fm=webp)

## Dedicated space for conversations

Decrease the burden of managing active work in issues and pull requests by providing a separate space to host ongoing discussions, questions, and ideas.

### Highlight quality responses and make the best answer more discoverable.

![The image is a screenshot of a forum discussion. The first comment, posted by "khayrizen" on March 22, 2022, asks for brainstorming new power-up ideas for a character named Mona. This comment has received 8 thumbs-up reactions and 5 up votes. Below it, "pavbez" responds, suggesting that a character named Hubot could deliver the power-ups, giving Mona superpowers similar to those provided by GitHub. The discussion highlights community engagement with reactions and replies.

### Keep context in-tact and conversations on track with threaded comments.

![The image is a screenshot of a conversation thread on a social media platform. The first comment is from "hankzolo" 20 minutes ago, suggesting that a power-up could call Hubot to reveal the path and protect Mona for a set period of time. This comment has received 5 likes and 5 replies. The second comment is from "pavbez" 18 minutes ago, proposing that Hubot could provide different types of power-ups or objects depending on levels. The third comment is from "hsiaohype" 15 minutes ago, expressing appreciation for the collaboration idea and stating it is perfect for the characters.

### Ask your community directly with custom polls.

![The image is a screenshot of a poll created by a user named "khayrizen" in the Feedback section, 10 minutes ago. The poll is titled "Power-up contest" and includes the following message: "I got a bunch of really cool ideas from y'all about how Hubot will help Mona in her quest. Now we need to choose the one we'll implement in the game. Pick your favorite!" Below this message, there are three options for what Mona needs: "Magic portals" with 24% of votes, "Her sidekick Hubot" with 51% of votes, and "A jetpack" with 25% of votes. The background is pink with rounded corners on the image.

### Leverage GraphQL API and webhooks to meet your teams wherever they are.

![The image is a screenshot of a Slack channel named "#community" within the "OctoSlack" workspace, which is part of the "Octoinvader-community." The background is pink with rounded corners. There are two messages from a user named "Robotocat." The first message announces a new poll created by another user, khayrizen, and includes a link to the "#1238 Power-up contest" discussion on GitHub. The second message indicates that glebosonic voted in the Power-up contest. The interface displays options for viewing pinned items, searching within the channel, and seeing member details.

### Give your open ended conversations the room they need outside of issues.

![The image is a screenshot of a discussion thread titled "Gameplay improvements #1192" marked as "Closed." Two comments are visible in the thread. The first comment is by a user named semyonrush, posted 10 minutes ago, saying, "Thanks for all the work on the latest updates to our game. This got me thinking, should we think about adding power-ups?" The second comment is by a user named khayrizen, posted 8 minutes ago, saying, "Let's move this conversation out of our mechanics work and ask the community." There are reaction icons below khayrizen's comment showing 5 thumbs up and 2 eyes emojis.

Code Search

# Exactly what you’re looking for

Your code—and the world’s—is at your fingertips.

[Try it now](/search?type=code)[Contact sales](/enterprise/contact?ref_cta=Contact+sales&ref_loc=hero&ref_page=%2Ffeatures%2Fcode-search&utm_content=Platform&utm_medium=site&utm_source=github)

![The image shows a computer screen with a code editor in dark mode, displaying a Rust programming language file named "vfmt.rs" from the GitHub repository "github.com/servo/rust-url." The left sidebar lists folders and files, while the main editor displays syntax-highlighted Rust code. Two floating panels on the right provide information about a class named "CodePoint" and search results for "impl CodePoint".

](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/4zdWoJhLRcNgdkRQn7lBG4/3467a5833e1b04ac12fd7f608d26dadb/code-search-hero.webp?fm=webp)

## Search, navigate, and understand your team’s code—and billions of lines of public code.

### Fast, relevant results

Code search understands your code—and brings you relevant results with incredible speed.

### A power user's dream

Search using regular expressions, boolean operations, keyboard shortcuts, and more.

### More than just search

Dig deeper with the all-new code view—tightly integrating browsing and code navigation.

## Way more than grep.

GitHub code search can search across multiple repositories and is always up to date. It understands your code, and puts the most relevant results first.

### Use the new search input to find symbols and files—and jump right to them.

![The image shows a search interface with the query "repo:rust-lang/rust CodePoint" entered in the search bar. Below the search bar, several results are listed under the "Code" section, including "class CodePoint" in "library/wtf8.rs" and "function CodePoint::from_u32_unchecked" in "library/std/src/sys_common/wtf8.rs." Each result has a "Jump to" link for navigation.

](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/6BNmNnrnjQOmKGtgJ6Y98a/b5d811287c10a882322f5a80bf4689de/features-code-search-search-input.webp)

### Know exactly what you’re looking for? Express it with our powerful search operators.

![The image displays three search queries. The first query is "org:rust-lang 'fatal error' NOT 'warning'". The second query is "/limits?/ repo:tensorflow/tensorflow". The third query is "validation (language:ruby OR language:python)". This image demonstrates examples of advanced search syntax, likely for use in a code repository or documentation search tool. It highlights the use of specific keywords, logical operators, and regular expressions to refine search results.

## Meet the all-new code view.

Dig deeper into complex codebases with tightly integrated search, code navigation and browsing.

### Instantly jump to definitions in over 10 languages. No setup required with Code navigation.

![The image shows a code editor interface with a dark theme. The screen displays information about a symbol named "CodePoint." It indicates that precise symbol matching has found 1 definition and 13 references for this symbol. There is an option to search for this symbol in all repositories. The definition of "CodePoint" is highlighted on line 45 with the code pub struct CodePoint {. Below, there are 24 references listed, including lines such as impl fmt::Debug for CodePoint { on line 51 and impl CodePoint { on line 58.

### Keep all your code in context and instantly switch files with the new file tree pane.

![The image shows a screenshot of a file directory in a code repository, likely from GitHub. The directory is named "main" and contains several folders and files. The folders listed are ".github," ".reuse," "LICENSES," "library," and "src." Within the "library" folder, there are four files: "backtrace.rs," "condvar.rs," "fs.rs," and "wtf8.rs."

## Application security

### Application security where found means fixed. Powered by GitHub Copilot Autofix.

![Screenshot illustrating GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) in action. The left side shows a line graph tracking the number of vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Moderate, Low) over time, with data points from January 1 to February 15, 2024. The right side displays a security bot's recommendation to fix a vulnerability in the code. The bot explains that user-provided input is being used in an HTTP response without sanitization, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The AI-suggested fix involves using the escape-html library to sanitize the input, with the old code in red and the new, corrected code in green. The background features a smooth blue gradient.](//images.ctfassets.net/8aevphvgewt8/6xhL3DGJWO81pKW5fKbPXp/2df90d737a5113f939607b84ce4b09d9/section-security-illo.webp)

#### What are the different GitHub pricing plans?

GitHub offers free and paid plans for storing and collaborating on code. Some plans are available only to personal accounts, while other plans are available only to organization and enterprise accounts. For more information about accounts, see ["Types of GitHub accounts."](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)

GitHub DevSecOps

# The AI-powered DevSecOps platform

With comprehensive security tools built into the developer workflow, you can build, secure, and ship all in one place.

## Integrate AI-powered security features directly into your development workflow, eliminating the need for third-party tools.

### Code scanning

Find and fix security issues before production with static application security testing (SAST).

### Secret scanning

Hunt, revoke, and prevent leaked secrets with automatic push protection.

### Supply chain security

Keep vulnerable dependencies out of your applications with software composition analysis (SCA).

### Give AI the heavy lifting

Organizations struggle to fix their backlog of vulnerabilities, despite the risks. Coming next, security managers can burn down years of security debt in one simple sprint.

### Frequently asked questions

#### How do I sponsor a project?

Sign in and start by navigating to [your dependencies](https://github.com/sponsors/explore), your [explore tab](https://github.com/explore), [trending repositories](https://github.com/explore), or [collections](https://github.com/collections). When a repository has the Sponsor graphic, you can sponsor them directly.

#### How do I get paid for my contributions?

You can become a sponsored developer by joining GitHub Sponsors, completing your sponsored developer profile, creating sponsorship tiers, submitting your bank and tax information, and enabling two-factor authentication for your account on GitHub.com. [Learn more about getting paid for contributions](https://docs.github.com/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-personal-account)

#### Do I need to fill out a tax form to receive sponsorships?

Yes. Your tax information must be on file in order for GitHub to make payments to your bank account. The required tax documents may vary based on your location.

Note that we do our best to help you with the Sponsors program, but we’re unable to provide tax guidance.

### FAQs

#### Can I use code hosting platforms other than GitHub for my repositories and still use GitHub Copilot?

Yes. GitHub Copilot functionality works in code editors regardless of code hosting platform. Some features are enhanced with the use of GitHub because Copilot can directly draw context and knowledge from repositories, pull requests, issues, and other data structures in the GitHub platform.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

## Frequently asked questions

### About GitHub Premium Support

### What is GitHub Premium Support for?

GitHub Premium Support helps customers implement GitHub Enterprise quickly and effectively across the organization with 24/7 support.

### How much does GitHub Premium Support cost?

For pricing information, please get in touch with the [GitHub Premium Support Sales](/enterprise/contact?ref_loc=faq&scid=&utm_campaign=2023q3-site-ww-PremiumSupport&utm_content=Premium+Support&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github) sales team.

### What are the levels of support in GitHub Premium Support?

There are three levels of support:

1. The basic plan included with your GitHub Enterprise license
2. GitHub Premium Support
3. GitHub Premium Plus Support

Please refer to our [plan comparison table](#plans) for more details.

### How do I contact GitHub Premium Support?

If you are an existing GitHub Premium Support customer, please sign in to our [support portal](https://support.github.com). If you don’t already have GitHub Premium Support, please [contact sales](/enterprise/contact?ref_loc=faq&scid=&utm_campaign=2023q3-site-ww-PremiumSupport&utm_content=Premium+Support&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github).

### Choosing your plan

### What is escalation and incident management?

Escalation and incident management is the ability to escalate ticket progression in the GitHub support portal. After someone escalates a ticket, Support Incident Coordinators orchestrate all necessary parties to resolve the ticket. Additionally, Senior Escalation Engineers (SEEs) facilitate GitHub-internal technical communications and liaise with the rest of GitHub to improve the support team’s capability in similar future circumstances.

### What is incident response management?

Incident response management helps manage the technical resources needed for case resolution. Support Incident Coordinators are available for incident response management 24/7.

### What are my SLAs for initial response?

GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers have SLAs. For urgent priority tickets, your SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high priority tickets, your SLA provides a four-hour initial response time.

### What’s included in initial troubleshooting?

For initial troubleshooting, the assigned Premium Support Engineer/Customer Reliability Engineer will review and acknowledge your ticket. To better understand the issue and start troubleshooting, the engineer may ask for additional information such as screenshots, error messages, log files, diagnostics files, support bundles, or the output of specific console commands. They may also collaborate with others in support, engineering, or in the regional incident commander.

If a callback was requested, the engineer will determine if screen sharing is the most effective way to drive ticket resolution. If so, they will invite you to join a screen-sharing session.

### How do I get health check reports?

GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers are entitled to unlimited automated health check reports. Additionally, GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request quarterly enhanced health checks with findings, interpretations, and recommendations from a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE).

### What is crisis prevention?

Crisis prevention allows GitHub Enterprise Server customers to prepare for — and experience — an incident without risk. Your Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) guides your team through an incident simulation in a safe and controlled environment.

Crisis Prevention consists of up to four sessions about reliability best practices, preparing for a potential incident, and efficiently interacting with GitHub Support. After the incident simulation, your CRE will run a detailed retrospective, uncovering lessons learned and improvement suggestions for the future.

### How long does GitHub Premium Support take?

GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support Plus customers have service-level agreements (SLAs) for initial response. For urgent priority tickets, the initial response SLA guarantees a 30-minute initial response time, which includes troubleshooting. For high-priority tickets, the initial response SLA provides a four-hour time.

We currently do not provide estimates for time to resolution, as the complexity of tickets varies. However, we review these metrics on a regular basis and reduce times whenever possible.

### How do I resolve a problem in GitHub Enterprise?

You can get support via online ticket submission if you’re using the basic plan included with your GitHub Enterprise license. If you have GitHub Premium Support or GitHub Premium Plus Support, you can submit a ticket online. For urgent tickets, GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers can request a callback and have a screen-sharing session with one of our Premium Support Engineers or Customer Reliability Engineers (CREs). Please refer to our [plan comparison table](#plans) for more details.

### Rules and policies

### If I do not use all the technical advisory hours in a given quarter, can they be carried over?

Premium Plus customers may use up to 12 technical advisory hours per quarter. Unused technical advisory hours may not be carried over into the next quarter.

### How can the technical advisory support hours be used?

There are multiple ways you can use technical advisory hours, including but not limited to:

* Consultations regarding GitHub best practices and general recommendations
* GitHub Enterprise Server upgrade preparation and assistance

### Does GitHub Premium Support provide service on weekends?

Yes! GitHub Premium Support and GitHub Premium Plus Support customers receive 24/7 support.

### Upgrading your plan

### What virtual trainings are available with GitHub Premium Plus Support and who can participate?

Customers get access to one virtual training class per year. Topics include:

* GitHub for developers
* GitHub for admins (Server)
* GitHub for admins (Cloud)
* GitHub for non-developers
* GH API Training
* GH Actions Fundamentals
* GH Actions Intermediate
* GH Copilot Fundamentals
* GH Copilot Intermediate
* GH Copilot Administration & Security
* GitHub Enterprise Implementation (Cloud)

We recommend limiting training sessions to a maximum of 16 participants to ensure an optimal provider-to-participant ratio and a high-quality delivery experience. However, in specific cases where it makes sense, we can accommodate up to 20–25 participants while maintaining our commitment to delivering a valuable training experience for your team.

### What value will I get by upgrading to GitHub Premium Plus Support?

GitHub Premium Plus Support customers get an assigned Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE), quarterly enhanced health checks, access to crisis prevention, technical advisory hours, and many additional benefits, which you can review in our [plan comparison table](#plans).

### What’s the benefit of having a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE) over a Premium Support Engineer?

A CRE knows your customer account in detail and can help you expedite case resolution faster than a Premium Support Engineer.

### Since I get GitHub Enterprise Support for free, why should I upgrade to GitHub Premium Support?

Most customers upgrade to GitHub Premium Support because they need initial response SLAs for urgent and high priority requests, phone support, screen share support for critical issues, and health checks. To see a full list of features for GitHub Premium Support packages, please refer to our [plan comparison table](#plans).

# MCP TypeScript SDK Guide

## Build & Test Commands

```
npm run build        # Build ESM and CJS versions
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm test             # Run all tests
npx jest path/to/file.test.ts  # Run specific test file
npx jest -t "test name"        # Run tests matching pattern
```

## Code Style Guidelines

* **TypeScript**: Strict type checking, ES modules, explicit return types
* **Naming**: PascalCase for classes/types, camelCase for functions/variables
* **Files**: Lowercase with hyphens, test files with `.test.ts` suffix
* **Imports**: ES module style, include `.js` extension, group imports logically
* **Error Handling**: Use TypeScript's strict mode, explicit error checking in tests
* **Formatting**: 2-space indentation, semicolons required, single quotes preferred
* **Testing**: Co-locate tests with source files, use descriptive test names
* **Comments**: JSDoc for public APIs, inline comments for complex logic

## Project Structure

* `/src`: Source code with client, server, and shared modules
* Tests alongside source files with `.test.ts` suffix
* Node.js >= 18 required

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[mcp-coc@anthropic.com](mailto:mcp-coc@anthropic.com).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction. This TypeScript SDK implements the full MCP specification, making it easy to:

* Build MCP clients that can connect to any MCP server
* Create MCP servers that expose resources, prompts and tools
* Use standard transports like stdio and Streamable HTTP
* Handle all MCP protocol messages and lifecycle events

## Installation

```
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

## Quick Start

Let's create a simple MCP server that exposes a calculator tool and some data:

```
import { McpServer, ResourceTemplate } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

// Create an MCP server
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Demo",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Add an addition tool
server.tool("add",
  { a: z.number(), b: z.number() },
  async ({ a, b }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: String(a + b) }]
  })
);

// Add a dynamic greeting resource
server.resource(
  "greeting",
  new ResourceTemplate("greeting://{name}", { list: undefined }),
  async (uri, { name }) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: `Hello, ${name}!`
    }]
  })
);

// Start receiving messages on stdin and sending messages on stdout
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

* Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
* Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
* Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
* And more!

## Core Concepts

### Server

The McpServer is your core interface to the MCP protocol. It handles connection management, protocol compliance, and message routing:

```
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "My App",
  version: "1.0.0"
});
```

### Resources

Resources are how you expose data to LLMs. They're similar to GET endpoints in a REST API - they provide data but shouldn't perform significant computation or have side effects:

```
// Static resource
server.resource(
  "config",
  "config://app",
  async (uri) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: "App configuration here"
    }]
  })
);

// Dynamic resource with parameters
server.resource(
  "user-profile",
  new ResourceTemplate("users://{userId}/profile", { list: undefined }),
  async (uri, { userId }) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: `Profile data for user ${userId}`
    }]
  })
);
```

### Tools

Tools let LLMs take actions through your server. Unlike resources, tools are expected to perform computation and have side effects:

```
// Simple tool with parameters
server.tool(
  "calculate-bmi",
  {
    weightKg: z.number(),
    heightM: z.number()
  },
  async ({ weightKg, heightM }) => ({
    content: [{
      type: "text",
      text: String(weightKg / (heightM * heightM))
    }]
  })
);

// Async tool with external API call
server.tool(
  "fetch-weather",
  { city: z.string() },
  async ({ city }) => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.weather.com/${city}`);
    const data = await response.text();
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: data }]
    };
  }
);
```

### Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates that help LLMs interact with your server effectively:

```
server.prompt(
  "review-code",
  { code: z.string() },
  ({ code }) => ({
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: `Please review this code:\n\n${code}`
      }
    }]
  })
);
```

## Running Your Server

MCP servers in TypeScript need to be connected to a transport to communicate with clients. How you start the server depends on the choice of transport:

### stdio

For command-line tools and direct integrations:

```
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// ... set up server resources, tools, and prompts ...

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Streamable HTTP

For remote servers, set up a Streamable HTTP transport that handles both client requests and server-to-client notifications.

#### With Session Management

In some cases, servers need to be stateful. This is achieved by [session management](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#session-management).

```
import express from "express";
import { randomUUID } from "node:crypto";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import { isInitializeRequest } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js"



const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Map to store transports by session ID
const transports: { [sessionId: string]: StreamableHTTPServerTransport } = {};

// Handle POST requests for client-to-server communication
app.post('/mcp', async (req, res) => {
  // Check for existing session ID
  const sessionId = req.headers['mcp-session-id'] as string | undefined;
  let transport: StreamableHTTPServerTransport;

  if (sessionId && transports[sessionId]) {
    // Reuse existing transport
    transport = transports[sessionId];
  } else if (!sessionId && isInitializeRequest(req.body)) {
    // New initialization request
    transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
      sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID(),
      onsessioninitialized: (sessionId) => {
        // Store the transport by session ID
        transports[sessionId] = transport;
      }
    });

    // Clean up transport when closed
    transport.onclose = () => {
      if (transport.sessionId) {
        delete transports[transport.sessionId];
      }
    };
    const server = new McpServer({
      name: "example-server",
      version: "1.0.0"
    });

    // ... set up server resources, tools, and prompts ...

    // Connect to the MCP server
    await server.connect(transport);
  } else {
    // Invalid request
    res.status(400).json({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      error: {
        code: -32000,
        message: 'Bad Request: No valid session ID provided',
      },
      id: null,
    });
    return;
  }

  // Handle the request
  await transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
});

// Reusable handler for GET and DELETE requests
const handleSessionRequest = async (req: express.Request, res: express.Response) => {
  const sessionId = req.headers['mcp-session-id'] as string | undefined;
  if (!sessionId || !transports[sessionId]) {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid or missing session ID');
    return;
  }
  
  const transport = transports[sessionId];
  await transport.handleRequest(req, res);
};

// Handle GET requests for server-to-client notifications via SSE
app.get('/mcp', handleSessionRequest);

// Handle DELETE requests for session termination
app.delete('/mcp', handleSessionRequest);

app.listen(3000);
```

#### Without Session Management (Stateless)

For simpler use cases where session management isn't needed:

```
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/mcp', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // In stateless mode, create a new instance of transport and server for each request
  // to ensure complete isolation. A single instance would cause request ID collisions
  // when multiple clients connect concurrently.
  
  try {
    const server = getServer(); 
    const transport: StreamableHTTPServerTransport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
      sessionIdGenerator: undefined,
    });
    res.on('close', () => {
      console.log('Request closed');
      transport.close();
      server.close();
    });
    await server.connect(transport);
    await transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error handling MCP request:', error);
    if (!res.headersSent) {
      res.status(500).json({
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        error: {
          code: -32603,
          message: 'Internal server error',
        },
        id: null,
      });
    }
  }
});

app.get('/mcp', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log('Received GET MCP request');
  res.writeHead(405).end(JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    error: {
      code: -32000,
      message: "Method not allowed."
    },
    id: null
  }));
});

app.delete('/mcp', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log('Received DELETE MCP request');
  res.writeHead(405).end(JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    error: {
      code: -32000,
      message: "Method not allowed."
    },
    id: null
  }));
});


// Start the server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`MCP Stateless Streamable HTTP Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

This stateless approach is useful for:

* Simple API wrappers
* RESTful scenarios where each request is independent
* Horizontally scaled deployments without shared session state

### Testing and Debugging

To test your server, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector). See its README for more information.

## Examples

### Echo Server

A simple server demonstrating resources, tools, and prompts:

```
import { McpServer, ResourceTemplate } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Echo",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

server.resource(
  "echo",
  new ResourceTemplate("echo://{message}", { list: undefined }),
  async (uri, { message }) => ({
    contents: [{
      uri: uri.href,
      text: `Resource echo: ${message}`
    }]
  })
);

server.tool(
  "echo",
  { message: z.string() },
  async ({ message }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: `Tool echo: ${message}` }]
  })
);

server.prompt(
  "echo",
  { message: z.string() },
  ({ message }) => ({
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: `Please process this message: ${message}`
      }
    }]
  })
);
```

### SQLite Explorer

A more complex example showing database integration:

```
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import sqlite3 from "sqlite3";
import { promisify } from "util";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "SQLite Explorer",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Helper to create DB connection
const getDb = () => {
  const db = new sqlite3.Database("database.db");
  return {
    all: promisify<string, any[]>(db.all.bind(db)),
    close: promisify(db.close.bind(db))
  };
};

server.resource(
  "schema",
  "schema://main",
  async (uri) => {
    const db = getDb();
    try {
      const tables = await db.all(
        "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"
      );
      return {
        contents: [{
          uri: uri.href,
          text: tables.map((t: {sql: string}) => t.sql).join("\n")
        }]
      };
    } finally {
      await db.close();
    }
  }
);

server.tool(
  "query",
  { sql: z.string() },
  async ({ sql }) => {
    const db = getDb();
    try {
      const results = await db.all(sql);
      return {
        content: [{
          type: "text",
          text: JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)
        }]
      };
    } catch (err: unknown) {
      const error = err as Error;
      return {
        content: [{
          type: "text",
          text: `Error: ${error.message}`
        }],
        isError: true
      };
    } finally {
      await db.close();
    }
  }
);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Dynamic Servers

If you want to offer an initial set of tools/prompts/resources, but later add additional ones based on user action or external state change, you can add/update/remove them *after* the Server is connected. This will automatically emit the corresponding `listChanged` notifications:

```
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Dynamic Example",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

const listMessageTool = server.tool(
  "listMessages",
  { channel: z.string() },
  async ({ channel }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: await listMessages(channel) }]
  })
);

const putMessageTool = server.tool(
  "putMessage",
  { channel: z.string(), message: z.string() },
  async ({ channel, message }) => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: await putMessage(channel, string) }]
  })
);
// Until we upgrade auth, `putMessage` is disabled (won't show up in listTools)
putMessageTool.disable()

const upgradeAuthTool = server.tool(
  "upgradeAuth",
  { permission: z.enum(["write', admin"])},
  // Any mutations here will automatically emit `listChanged` notifications
  async ({ permission }) => {
    const { ok, err, previous } = await upgradeAuthAndStoreToken(permission)
    if (!ok) return {content: [{ type: "text", text: `Error: ${err}` }]}

    // If we previously had read-only access, 'putMessage' is now available
    if (previous === "read") {
      putMessageTool.enable()
    }

    if (permission === 'write') {
      // If we've just upgraded to 'write' permissions, we can still call 'upgradeAuth' 
      // but can only upgrade to 'admin'. 
      upgradeAuthTool.update({
        paramSchema: { permission: z.enum(["admin"]) }, // change validation rules
      })
    } else {
      // If we're now an admin, we no longer have anywhere to upgrade to, so fully remove that tool
      upgradeAuthTool.remove()
    }
  }
)

// Connect as normal
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Low-Level Server

For more control, you can use the low-level Server class directly:

```
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import {
  ListPromptsRequestSchema,
  GetPromptRequestSchema
} from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js";

const server = new Server(
  {
    name: "example-server",
    version: "1.0.0"
  },
  {
    capabilities: {
      prompts: {}
    }
  }
);

server.setRequestHandler(ListPromptsRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    prompts: [{
      name: "example-prompt",
      description: "An example prompt template",
      arguments: [{
        name: "arg1",
        description: "Example argument",
        required: true
      }]
    }]
  };
});

server.setRequestHandler(GetPromptRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  if (request.params.name !== "example-prompt") {
    throw new Error("Unknown prompt");
  }
  return {
    description: "Example prompt",
    messages: [{
      role: "user",
      content: {
        type: "text",
        text: "Example prompt text"
      }
    }]
  };
});

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

### Writing MCP Clients

The SDK provides a high-level client interface:

```
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";

const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: "node",
  args: ["server.js"]
});

const client = new Client(
  {
    name: "example-client",
    version: "1.0.0"
  }
);

await client.connect(transport);

// List prompts
const prompts = await client.listPrompts();

// Get a prompt
const prompt = await client.getPrompt({
  name: "example-prompt",
  arguments: {
    arg1: "value"
  }
});

// List resources
const resources = await client.listResources();

// Read a resource
const resource = await client.readResource({
  uri: "file:///example.txt"
});

// Call a tool
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "example-tool",
  arguments: {
    arg1: "value"
  }
});
```

### Proxy Authorization Requests Upstream

You can proxy OAuth requests to an external authorization provider:

```
import express from 'express';
import { ProxyOAuthServerProvider } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/auth/providers/proxyProvider.js';
import { mcpAuthRouter } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/auth/router.js';

const app = express();

const proxyProvider = new ProxyOAuthServerProvider({
    endpoints: {
        authorizationUrl: "https://auth.external.com/oauth2/v1/authorize",
        tokenUrl: "https://auth.external.com/oauth2/v1/token",
        revocationUrl: "https://auth.external.com/oauth2/v1/revoke",
    },
    verifyAccessToken: async (token) => {
        return {
            token,
            clientId: "123",
            scopes: ["openid", "email", "profile"],
        }
    },
    getClient: async (client_id) => {
        return {
            client_id,
            redirect_uris: ["http://localhost:3000/callback"],
        }
    }
})

app.use(mcpAuthRouter({
    provider: proxyProvider,
    issuerUrl: new URL("http://auth.external.com"),
    baseUrl: new URL("http://mcp.example.com"),
    serviceDocumentationUrl: new URL("https://docs.example.com/"),
}))
```

This setup allows you to:

* Forward OAuth requests to an external provider
* Add custom token validation logic
* Manage client registrations
* Provide custom documentation URLs
* Maintain control over the OAuth flow while delegating to an external provider

### Backwards Compatibility

Clients and servers with StreamableHttp tranport can maintain [backwards compatibility](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#backwards-compatibility) with the deprecated HTTP+SSE transport (from protocol version 2024-11-05) as follows

#### Client-Side Compatibility

For clients that need to work with both Streamable HTTP and older SSE servers:

```
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";
import { SSEClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/sse.js";
let client: Client|undefined = undefined
const baseUrl = new URL(url);
try {
  client = new Client({
    name: 'streamable-http-client',
    version: '1.0.0'
  });
  const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(
    new URL(baseUrl)
  );
  await client.connect(transport);
  console.log("Connected using Streamable HTTP transport");
} catch (error) {
  // If that fails with a 4xx error, try the older SSE transport
  console.log("Streamable HTTP connection failed, falling back to SSE transport");
  client = new Client({
    name: 'sse-client',
    version: '1.0.0'
  });
  const sseTransport = new SSEClientTransport(baseUrl);
  await client.connect(sseTransport);
  console.log("Connected using SSE transport");
}
```

#### Server-Side Compatibility

For servers that need to support both Streamable HTTP and older clients:

```
import express from "express";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";
import { SSEServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "backwards-compatible-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// ... set up server resources, tools, and prompts ...

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Store transports for each session type
const transports = {
  streamable: {} as Record<string, StreamableHTTPServerTransport>,
  sse: {} as Record<string, SSEServerTransport>
};

// Modern Streamable HTTP endpoint
app.all('/mcp', async (req, res) => {
  // Handle Streamable HTTP transport for modern clients
  // Implementation as shown in the "With Session Management" example
  // ...
});

// Legacy SSE endpoint for older clients
app.get('/sse', async (req, res) => {
  // Create SSE transport for legacy clients
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  transports.sse[transport.sessionId] = transport;
  
  res.on("close", () => {
    delete transports.sse[transport.sessionId];
  });
  
  await server.connect(transport);
});

// Legacy message endpoint for older clients
app.post('/messages', async (req, res) => {
  const sessionId = req.query.sessionId as string;
  const transport = transports.sse[sessionId];
  if (transport) {
    await transport.handlePostMessage(req, res, req.body);
  } else {
    res.status(400).send('No transport found for sessionId');
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

**Note**: The SSE transport is now deprecated in favor of Streamable HTTP. New implementations should use Streamable HTTP, and existing SSE implementations should plan to migrate.

Fix Ajv import compatibility issue by downgrading to v6

Downgrade Ajv from v8.17.1 to v6.12.6 to resolve ESM/CJS module compatibility issues that were causing "does not provide an export named 'Ajv'" errors in projects using this SDK. This ensures consistent import patterns across different module systems.

# MCP Inspector

The MCP inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

[![MCP Inspector Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/main/mcp-inspector.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/main/mcp-inspector.png)

## Architecture Overview

The MCP Inspector consists of two main components that work together:

* **MCP Inspector Client (MCPI)**: A React-based web UI that provides an interactive interface for testing and debugging MCP servers
* **MCP Proxy (MCPP)**: A Node.js server that acts as a protocol bridge, connecting the web UI to MCP servers via various transport methods (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)

Note that the proxy is not a network proxy for intercepting traffic. Instead, it functions as both an MCP client (connecting to your MCP server) and an HTTP server (serving the web UI), enabling browser-based interaction with MCP servers that use different transport protocols.

## Running the Inspector

### Requirements

* Node.js: ^22.7.5

### Quick Start (UI mode)

To get up and running right away with the UI, just execute the following:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

The server will start up and the UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:6274`.

### From an MCP server repository

To inspect an MCP server implementation, there's no need to clone this repo. Instead, use `npx`. For example, if your server is built at `build/index.js`:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

You can pass both arguments and environment variables to your MCP server. Arguments are passed directly to your server, while environment variables can be set using the `-e` flag:

```
# Pass arguments only
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js arg1 arg2

# Pass environment variables only
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e key=value -e key2=$VALUE2 node build/index.js

# Pass both environment variables and arguments
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e key=value -e key2=$VALUE2 node build/index.js arg1 arg2

# Use -- to separate inspector flags from server arguments
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e key=$VALUE -- node build/index.js -e server-flag
```

The inspector runs both an MCP Inspector (MCPI) client UI (default port 6274) and an MCP Proxy (MCPP) server (default port 6277). Open the MCPI client UI in your browser to use the inspector. (These ports are derived from the T9 dialpad mapping of MCPI and MCPP respectively, as a mnemonic). You can customize the ports if needed:

```
CLIENT_PORT=8080 SERVER_PORT=9000 npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

For more details on ways to use the inspector, see the [Inspector section of the MCP docs site](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector). For help with debugging, see the [Debugging guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging).

### Servers File Export

The MCP Inspector provides convenient buttons to export server launch configurations for use in clients such as Cursor, Claude Code, or the Inspector's CLI. The file is usually called `mcp.json`.

* **Server Entry** - Copies a single server configuration entry to your clipboard. This can be added to your `mcp.json` file inside the `mcpServers` object with your preferred server name.

  **STDIO transport example:**

  ```
  {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["build/index.js", "--debug"],
    "env": {
      "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
      "DEBUG": "true"
    }
  }
  ```

  **SSE transport example:**

  ```
  {
    "type": "sse",
    "url": "http://localhost:3000/events",
    "note": "For SSE connections, add this URL directly in Client"
  }
  ```
* **Servers File** - Copies a complete MCP configuration file structure to your clipboard, with your current server configuration added as `default-server`. This can be saved directly as `mcp.json`.

  **STDIO transport example:**

  ```
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "default-server": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["build/index.js", "--debug"],
        "env": {
          "API_KEY": "your-api-key",
          "DEBUG": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  **SSE transport example:**

  ```
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "default-server": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://localhost:3000/events",
        "note": "For SSE connections, add this URL directly in Client"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

These buttons appear in the Inspector UI after you've configured your server settings, making it easy to save and reuse your configurations.

For SSE transport connections, the Inspector provides similar functionality for both buttons. The "Server Entry" button copies the SSE URL configuration that can be added to your existing configuration file, while the "Servers File" button creates a complete configuration file containing the SSE URL for direct use in clients.

You can paste the Server Entry into your existing `mcp.json` file under your chosen server name, or use the complete Servers File payload to create a new configuration file.

### Authentication

The inspector supports bearer token authentication for SSE connections. Enter your token in the UI when connecting to an MCP server, and it will be sent in the Authorization header. You can override the header name using the input field in the sidebar.

### Security Considerations

The MCP Inspector includes a proxy server that can run and communicate with local MCP processes. The proxy server should not be exposed to untrusted networks as it has permissions to spawn local processes and can connect to any specified MCP server.

#### Authentication

The MCP Inspector proxy server requires authentication by default. When starting the server, a random session token is generated and printed to the console:

```
🔑 Session token: 3a1c267fad21f7150b7d624c160b7f09b0b8c4f623c7107bbf13378f051538d4

🔗 Open inspector with token pre-filled:
   http://localhost:6274/?MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN=3a1c267fad21f7150b7d624c160b7f09b0b8c4f623c7107bbf13378f051538d4

```

This token must be included as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for all requests to the server. When authentication is enabled, auto-open is disabled by default to ensure you use the secure URL.

**Recommended: Use the pre-filled URL** - Click or copy the link shown in the console to open the inspector with the token already configured.

**Alternative: Manual configuration** - If you already have the inspector open:

1. Click the "Configuration" button in the sidebar
2. Find "Proxy Session Token" and enter the token displayed in the proxy console
3. Click "Save" to apply the configuration

The token will be saved in your browser's local storage for future use.

If you need to disable authentication (NOT RECOMMENDED), you can set the `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH` environment variable:

```
DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true npm start
```

#### Local-only Binding

By default, the MCP Inspector proxy server binds only to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) to prevent network access. This ensures the server is not accessible from other devices on the network. If you need to bind to all interfaces for development purposes, you can override this with the `HOST` environment variable:

```
HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
```

**Warning:** Only bind to all interfaces in trusted network environments, as this exposes the proxy server's ability to execute local processes.

#### DNS Rebinding Protection

To prevent DNS rebinding attacks, the MCP Inspector validates the `Origin` header on incoming requests. By default, only requests from the client origin are allowed (respects `CLIENT_PORT` if set, defaulting to port 6274). You can configure additional allowed origins by setting the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable (comma-separated list):

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:6274,http://127.0.0.1:6274,http://localhost:8000 npm start
```

### Configuration

The MCP Inspector supports the following configuration settings. To change them, click on the `Configuration` button in the MCP Inspector UI:

| Setting | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MCP_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for requests to the MCP server (ms) | 10000 |
| `MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_RESET_ON_PROGRESS` | Reset timeout on progress notifications | true |
| `MCP_REQUEST_MAX_TOTAL_TIMEOUT` | Maximum total timeout for requests sent to the MCP server (ms) (Use with progress notifications) | 60000 |
| `MCP_PROXY_FULL_ADDRESS` | Set this if you are running the MCP Inspector Proxy on a non-default address. Example: <http://10.1.1.22:5577> | "" |
| `MCP_AUTO_OPEN_ENABLED` | Enable automatic browser opening when inspector starts. Only as environment var, not configurable in browser. | true |

These settings can be adjusted in real-time through the UI and will persist across sessions.

The inspector also supports configuration files to store settings for different MCP servers. This is useful when working with multiple servers or complex configurations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --config path/to/config.json --server everything
```

Example server configuration file:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "everything": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"],
      "env": {
        "hello": "Hello MCP!"
      }
    },
    "my-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["build/index.js", "arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {
        "key": "value",
        "key2": "value2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** You can easily generate this configuration format using the **Server Entry** and **Servers File** buttons in the Inspector UI, as described in the Servers File Export section above.

You can also set the initial `transport` type, `serverUrl`, `serverCommand`, and `serverArgs` via query params, for example:

```
http://localhost:6274/?transport=sse&serverUrl=http://localhost:8787/sse
http://localhost:6274/?transport=streamable-http&serverUrl=http://localhost:8787/mcp
http://localhost:6274/?transport=stdio&serverCommand=npx&serverArgs=arg1%20arg2

```

You can also set initial config settings via query params, for example:

```
http://localhost:6274/?MCP_SERVER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=10000&MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_RESET_ON_PROGRESS=false&MCP_PROXY_FULL_ADDRESS=http://10.1.1.22:5577

```

Note that if both the query param and the corresponding localStorage item are set, the query param will take precedence.

### From this repository

If you're working on the inspector itself:

Development mode:

```
npm run dev
```

> **Note for Windows users:**
> On Windows, use the following command instead:
>
> ```
> npm run dev:windows
> ```

Production mode:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

### CLI Mode

CLI mode enables programmatic interaction with MCP servers from the command line, ideal for scripting, automation, and integration with coding assistants. This creates an efficient feedback loop for MCP server development.

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js
```

The CLI mode supports most operations across tools, resources, and prompts. A few examples:

```
# Basic usage
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js

# With config file
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli --config path/to/config.json --server myserver

# List available tools
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js --method tools/list

# Call a specific tool
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js --method tools/call --tool-name mytool --tool-arg key=value --tool-arg another=value2

# List available resources
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js --method resources/list

# List available prompts
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli node build/index.js --method prompts/list

# Connect to a remote MCP server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli https://my-mcp-server.example.com

# Call a tool on a remote server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli https://my-mcp-server.example.com --method tools/call --tool-name remotetool --tool-arg param=value

# List resources from a remote server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli https://my-mcp-server.example.com --method resources/list
```

## About me

Hi, I'm Justin! 👋

I'm very excited and very worried about the potential of AI, which is why I work at [Anthropic PBC](https://anthropic.com). I'm currently part of the team developing and maintaining the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). *Note that my opinions don't reflect those of my employer.*

Previously, I worked at various other companies—notably Meta and GitHub—and have done some independent consulting as well.

In a past life, I contributed significantly to some open source projects in the iOS and macOS ecosystem:

* [ReactiveCocoa](https://reactivecocoa.io/): reactive programming in Swift and Objective-C
* [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle): a model framework for Cocoa
* [Squirrel](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac): robust software update framework for Mac apps
* [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage): a decentralized dependency manager

I may not be able to respond to pings and reachouts—sorry in advance.

## Cliff Hall

💥 Availability for Consulting

### I consult corp-to-corp through my company [Futurescale](https://futurescale.com).

* 🔍 - My primary focus is artificial intelligence, specifically enabling teams of agents to perform long horizon tasks with MCP.
* 🧭 - I was recently invited to become a member of the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) maintainers and steering committee.
* 📅 - If you'd like to hire me or just chat about something interesting, you can grab a slot on [my calendar](https://calendly.com/cliffhall).
* 📋 - Here are my [resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cliffhall/cliffhall/main/media/Cliff-Hall-Resume-2025.pdf) and [recommendations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cliffhall/cliffhall/main/media/Cliff-Hall-Recommendations.pdf) if you're interested.
🔪 Sharpest Blades in the Drawer

### Software Engineering

I've slung a lot of code since the days of 6502 assembly for C64 and the Apple ][. Here's where I'm strongest at the moment.

* React
* Node
* JSX
* Typescript
* JavaScript
* OpenAI API
* Model Context Protocol (MCP) - I am a contributor and maintainer

### Project Leadership

I enjoy leading remote, globally distributed teams to success. This requires continuous integration, unit testing with an aim for 100% coverage, and rigorous code review. It makes a team stronger and certainly elevates code quality. The highest compliment for a team I've led was that the codebase appeared as if created by one person.

A common thing I see is domain language drift across teams and departments acting as a major source of friction and misunderstanding, both internally and with . That's why I approach new projects with domain-driven design, i.e., agree upon the things and the processes that operate on the things first (nouns and verbs). Build a glossary for the project and everyone from code to marketing is on the same page from the jump.

### Software Architecture

With every new system design, I am guided by Einstein's maxim: "As simple as possible, no simpler."

Within modular software, the biggest problem is separation of concerns, e.g., not muddling view handling responsibiilities with business logic and domain logic. As opposed to toolkits which offer a grab bag of utilities, frameworks help developers focus on requirements by providing a set of actors with roles, relationships, and collaboration patterns that solve for separation of concerns.

When I began working for large enterprise clients, I noticed that the frameworks avaialble for the prevalent development stacks were overcomplicated and made maintenance harder. Junior team members often struggled to understand the collaboration patterns at play between the framework actors. This led to messy, confusing code that is hard to maintain.

So in 2004, I created the [PureMVC Framework](https://puremvc.org). PureMVC is a lightweight, object-oriented MVC architecture that was eventually ported to over 15 programming languages and is still used today. Also wrote the [O'Reilly book](http://oreil.ly/puremvc).

### Building Agents

* ✨ [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. I am a contributor, maintainer, and member of the MCP Steering Committee.
* ✨ [Puzzlebox](https://github.com/cliffhall/puzzlebox) is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that hosts finite state machines (called puzzles). With the GooseTeam project, we learned that attempting to make agents collaborate with a protocol for collaboration can generate results. But where it gets muddled is with non-trivial projects that need to employ phases. Inception, specification, design, building, etc. Within one of those phases an approach like GooseTeam can work well. This is where Puzzlebox comes in. It exposes tools to create and manipulate puzzles, moving state machines through their states. Clients can subscribe to individual state machines to receive updates when their state and available actions change.
* ✨ [GooseTeam](https://github.com/cliffhall/GooseTeam?tab=readme-ov-file#gooseteam) is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server I wrote for enabling collaboration between a team of [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) agents. Given an arbitrarily complex project such as outlining a television series pilot or creating a non-trivial software application, the agents utilize tools exposed by the MCP to plan, assign, and complete tasks in service of the goal. This project is pioneering the use of [mermaid markdown for controlling agents](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/controlling-agents-mermaid-markdown-clifford-hall-of9pe/?trackingId=AoMJVL8VSTOnrQs5W2X81A%3D%3D).

### Solving Domain-specific Problems with AI

* ✨ At [Culturalyst](https://culturalyst.com), I recently built an arts and culture focused, city-specific [AI assistant for improving artist discovery](https://futurescale.com/2024/11/15/arts-and-culture-concierge-ai-assistant/). Separately, I overcame a showstopping issue with gathering artist opportunities from around the web and delivering to subscribing artists those relevant to their discipline and experience. With AI, I was able to [classify opportunities from arbitrary sites](https://futurescale.com/2023/11/10/artist-opportunity-classification-with-ai/) into our taxonomy, normalizing the data into our domain model such that they appeared to have been entered through our own UI.
* ✨ With [PlotRocket](https://plotrocket.app), an AI-assisted series planner and episode outliner, I am combining artificial intelligence with common industry practices for creating episodic fiction, yielding a tool capable of planning multiple seasons of a television series down to the scene and beat. With or without the use of AI. It allows anyone to turn an idea into an engaging episodic story.

### Letting crypto go

In 2018 I began working with Solidity, convinced that NFTs (not crypto) might actually be useful. I documented my developer journey in a webseries as I discovered how radically different the field was from any other language or environment I had ever worked on. It was bewildering, interesting, and greenfields as far as the eye could see. Everything hadn't been built, and the possibilities were endless.

Since then, crypto scams and the vicissitudes of the market have made it impossible to work in as a professional developer for hire, so I have decided to redirect all of my focus to AI, but I learned a lot on my blockchain journey, and met a lot of great people along the way.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)

A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

# Model Context Protocol servers

This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references
to community built servers and additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Each MCP server is implemented with either the [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) or [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository

Typescript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`.

For example, this will start the [Memory](/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/memory) server:

```
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). `uvx` is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the [Git](/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/git) server:

```
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

Follow [these](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instructions to install `uv` / `uvx` and [these](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install `pip`.

### Using an MCP Client

However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```
